# FlashCard
Must run `npm install bcrypt` first


Notes: I wanted to get back into web development and felt like I needed to brush up on some javascript. This FlashCard app was built with [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) in mind. I've been learning Mandarin these last few months and figured the best way to review is by using this learning technique.

This project is also missing some "nice to have" features. Some of my todo's is leveraging the entire code base to use javascript Promise, integegrate or implement an ORM library, and refactor the routes.
